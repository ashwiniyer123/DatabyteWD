    I have tried to incorporate required features in the game, however I could not complete it on time. 

    There is a 4x4 card matrix. The back side is visible and it is light blue in color.
    On clicking, the cards rotate, and one of the colors - yellow/red/blue/green - is displayed.
    Additional JS code is required to match if the colors shown by 2 cards selected is same and to increase the score.
    Timer of 30sec is provided. Once it reaches 0, it pauses for a second and closes the window.
